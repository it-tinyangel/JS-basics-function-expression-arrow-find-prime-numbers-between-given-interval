# Find Prime Numbers Between numbers in a Given Interval

A function that searches for prime numbers in an interval and outputs them to console.log().
The interval is determined by the numbers that the user enters. The function takes these two numbers as parameters.

The code is divided into two main parts:

     - function primeNumber(num) to check the simplicity of numbers;
     
     - function simpleNumber() to find simple numbers in a given interval.

* made changes to the .js file regarding interval limits, given that prime number searches are between numbers entered by the user.
