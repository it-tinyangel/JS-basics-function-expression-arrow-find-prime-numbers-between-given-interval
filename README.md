# Find Prime Numbers Between Given Interval

A function that looks for primes in an interval and outputs them to the console.log(). The interval is determined by the numbers that the user enters. The function takes these two numbers as parameters.

The code is divided into two main parts:
 - function primeNumber(num) to check the simplicity of numbers;
 - simpleNumber() function for finding simple numbers in a given interval.
